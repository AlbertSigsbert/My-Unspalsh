<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
I had a great experience and fun building this project.

I first started styling components based on Figma designs using tailwindcss, then after that, I implemented image upload functionality using NextJS.

For Image uploading I utilized firebase storage SDK, to manage the global state I used the Context API and finally  for the copy-to-clipboard functionality I used the browser's built-in Clipboard API
